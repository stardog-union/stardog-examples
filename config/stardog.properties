# Stardog Configuration Example
# -----------------------------
# This file contains example Stardog configuration properties to configure Stardog's global behavior. Stardog 
# configuration file should be named 'stardog.properties' and put into the Stardog home directory to take effect.
# Any changes to Stardog configuration requires the Stardog server to be restarted if it is already running. 
#

# Query Answering
# ---------------
# This option controls the behavior for answering queries that don't specify a dataset (FROM or FROM NAMED) in 
# the query. In such cases, the SPARQL specification says that the query should be answered only using the 
# default graph (no named graphs). However, sometimes it is desirable to answer such queries using all
# the information in the database, including the default graph and all named graphs. Setting this option to true
# changes the behavior of Stardog to do this. Queries that specify a dataset are not affected by this option.
# 
# query.all.graphs = true

# Default query timeout duration for all databases in this server. Once a query execution time exceeds this limit
# the query will be automatically killed by Stardog and the client will receive an error message. This value can be
# overridden by a database-specific timeout value in database options. If this value is set to 0 then no query will 
# timeout unless overridden by the database option. The default value for this option is 5 minutes.
# <p>
# The timeout values specified in the property file should be a positive integer followed by either letter 'h' (for
# hours), letter 'm' (for minutes), letter 's' (for seconds), or letters 'ms' (for milliseconds). 
# Examples: '1h' for 1 hour, '5m' for 5 minutes, '90s' for 90 seconds, '500ms' for 500 milliseconds.
# 
# query.timeout = 500ms


# Access Log
# ----------
# Logs all connection-based events, such as queries and transactional changes, and authentication events. Connection
# boundary events, that is open and closing of the actual connection, are not logged. 
#
# Access log is disabled by default and should be enabled explicitly in the configuration file by uncommenting the next 
# two lines. The type of the log is required and there are two allowed values 'text' and 'binary', both based on Protobuf. 
# In text logs, entries are serialized as key-value pairs in plain text and log entries are delimited by the ASCII Start 
# of Text and ASCII End of Text bytes. In binary logs, entries are written as size delimited protobuf binary messages.
# 
# logging.access.enabled = true
# logging.access.type = text
#
# [Optional] File name. By default, access log is saved as a file named 'access.log' inside the ${STARDOG_HOME}
# directory. Optionally a different file name can be provided as follows. An absolute path can be provided to save the 
# file in a different directory.
#
# logging.access.file = access.log
#
# [Optional] File rotation. It is possible to define a file rotation strategy so that log entries will be split into multiple
# files. One possibility is to define a limit on file size and start a new file when the size limit is reached. The file
# that exceeds the limit will be renamed with a unique suffix and all the subsequent entries will be added to the newly
# created file. The size limit is defined in bytes as follows. See audit log example for defining an alternative way of
# rotating files based on fixed-time intervals. 
#
# logging.access.rotation.type = size
# logging.access.rotation.limit = 1000000


# Audit Log
# ----------
# Logs all events and is a superset of the access log. 
#
# Audit log is disabled by default and should be enabled explicitly in the configuration file by uncommenting the next
# two lines.
#
# logging.audit.enabled = true
# logging.audit.type = binary
#
# [Optional] File name. By default, audit log is saved as a file named 'audit.log' inside the ${STARDOG_HOME} 
# directory. Optionally a different file name can be provided as follows. An absolute path can be provided to save the 
# file in a different directory.
#
# logging.audit.file = audit.log
#
# [Optional] File rotation. Audit logs can be rotated similar to access logs. Size limit can be used as described above. 
# Alternately, log files can be rotated at fixed time intervals. The interval value should be a positive integer 
# followed by either letter 'd' (for days) or letter 'h' (for hours). Examples intervals are '7d' for weekly logs, '1d' 
# for daily logs, '12h' for two log files per day, and '1h' for hourly logs. 
#
# logging.audit.rotation.type = time
# logging.audit.rotation.interval = 1d
#
# Note, while it is unlikely that both access and audit logging should be enabled, Stardog will not prevent you from 
# doing that. But it's strictly superfluous since audit logging is a strict superset of access logging; i.e., the former 
# can be created from the latter offline.


# Slow Query Log
# --------------
# Logs all slow queries. A query is considered to be slow if its execution time exceeds the slow_query.time value
# defined below. 
#
# Slow log query should be enabled similar to other logs 
#
# logging.slow_query.enabled = true
#
# Slow query time is specified as follows. Any query whose execution time exceed this limit will be logged in the slow
# query log. The time value should be a positive integer followed by either letter 'h' (for hours), letter 'm' (for minutes), 
# letter 's' (for seconds), or letters 'ms' (for milliseconds). Examples intervals are '1h' for 1 hour, '5m' for 5 minutes, 
# '90s' for 90 seconds, and '500ms' for 500 milliseconds. If no time is specified in the configuration, the default value
# of 1 minute will be used. 
# 
# logging.slow_query.time = 10s
#
# [Optional] Log type. Unlike access or audit logs, slow query log has a default type for formatting the slow query events
# which is intended to be human-readable. If no log type is specified, this default type will be used. This default format
# is not suitable for machine-processing and meant to be only for developers to read. For a machine-processable format,
# the type of the slow query log can be set similar to other logs.  
#
# logging.slow_query.type = text | binary
#
# [Optional] File name and rotation. By default, slow query log is saved as a file named 'slow_query.log' inside the 
# ${STARDOG_HOME} directory. Optionally a different file name and a file rotation can be provided similar to other
# logs. See the instructions above.


# Log Failure
# ----------- 
# There is an additional flag for controlling how failure to create a log is interpreted.  By default, a warning message 
# is printed to the system logs. But, for example, if you are using the audit logs you may not want to start the server 
# *without* audit logging and want any failure to be interpreted as a fatal error. You can use the following setting
# for this purpose.
#
# logging.create.failure.fatal = true 


# Connection configuration
# ------------------------
# Connections that have been idle for a specified amount of time are automatically closed by the server. The following
# option specifies this limit in milliseconds. The default limit is 3600000 (1 hour).
#
# database.connection.timeout.ms = 30000


# HTTP Configuration
# ------------------
# The maximum number of simultaneous http connections for a client is configured by the following two options. 
# See http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/tutorial/html/connmgmt.html
#
# http.max.connections = 200
#
# The length in characters of the longest query that can be sent over HTTP GET to the Stardog server. This is to avoid 
# URL overflow in some web servers.  When the query is longer than this threshold, Stardog will automatically switch 
# over to using HTTP POST. 
#
# http.max.get.query.length = 2000

# Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
# ------------------
# By default, CORS is enabled on Stardog's HTTP server (it can be disabled when starting the server via the CLI by
# including the --no-cors flag). In order for any cross-origin requests to be acknowledged, their Origin header value
# must be included in this list.
#
# cors.allowed.origins = http://stardog.com, http://example.org


# Waldo Configuration
# ------------------
# Configure whether or not an additional step of performing a describe over the literal being index should be performed
# while building search indexes.  false by default, setting this value to true can allow for more accurate searches by
# including information about the triples referencing the literal to its search index.  However, this also slows down
# search indexing and increases the size of the search index.
#
# waldo.describe.during.indexing = true
#
# Use of wildcards as the leading character in a search string is not enabled by default as this tends to be an expensive
# operation, this is mentioned in the Lucene FAQ (http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/LuceneFAQ).  However, if your use
# case requires leading wild card searches, they can be enabled by setting this property to true.
#
# leading.wildcard.search.enabled = true


# Watchdog JMX Configuration
# --------------------------
# Explicitly enable or disable the Watchdog JMX module.  Has no effect if Watchdog is not available or disabled directly
# due to license restrictions.  The default is true.
#
# watchdog.enabled = true
#
# Specify whether or not Watchdog should be accessible remotely.  When true, you will be able to access the Watchdog JMX
# server remotely at the default port (5833) or the specified 'watchdog.jmx.port'.  If false, the Watchdog JMX server
# will only be accessible via the process running the JVM.  The default value is 'true'
#
# watchdog.remote.access = true
#
# If the Watchdog JMX server is configured for remote access, by default, it will bind to port 5833.  You can provide a
# different port for the server by setting this property
#
# watchdog.port = 5833


# SSL
# ---
# If you would like to set any of the standard system properties for SSL support, you can provide them here rather than
# via the standard JVM arguments.  Note that these specify the global defaults, they can be overridden on a case by
# case basis using the appropriate ServerOptions.
#
# Specify the password for the keystore.
#
# javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword = myKeyStorePassword
#
# Specify the location of the keystore.  If this is not specified, $STARDOG_home/keystore is checked, and then, the
# standard JVM locations within $JAVA_HOME.
#
# javax.net.ssl.keyStore = /path/to/the/keystore
#
# Finally, if the keystore is of a different type than the default (JKS), you can specify its type:
#
# javax.net.ssl.keyStoreType = FOO

# Backups
# ---
# Specify the top level directory which is to be used by Stardog for storing backups.  By default, this is the
# '.backup' directory in your Stardog home, but you can use this property to specify a different location for
# backups.  Within this directory, backups are stored by database, and for each database, in date-versioned
# directories.
#
# Your typical backup directory would have a layout similar to this:
# .backup/myDb/2013-10-02
# .backup/myDb/2013-10-11
# .backup/myOtherDb/2013-06-21
#
# Within each of those directories are the actual backups themselves.  If you want to restore a database from
# one of those backups, you will have to use the complete path to the backup, not just the path to the top
# level directory as specified by this property, ie, `db restore $STARDOG_HOME/.backup/myDb/2013-10-02`
#
# backup.dir = /path/to/backup/directory

# Exports
# ---
# Specify the top-level directory for storing files which are exported by the server.  The default value is '.exports'
# in your $STARDOG_HOME directory.
#
# export.dir = /path/to/export/directory

# Geospatial
# ---
# Stardog’s geospatial support covers the use of basic WKT formatted shapes; specifically points and rectangles. However,
# WKT can encode more complex spatial structures, most notably, polygons.

# To enable support for these more complex shapes, download JTS and include its JAR in Stardog’s server classpath. Then 
# set the following property to true.
#
# spatial.use.jts=true

# BITES
# ---
# Stardog internally stores documents as files. The location of these files defaults to a subdirectory of STARDOG_HOME but 
# this can be overridden with the following properties. Documents can be stored on local filesystem, or an abstraction
# thereof, accessible from the Stardog server or on Amazon S3 by setting the docs.filesystem.uri configuration option.

# docs.filesystem.uri

# The exact location is given by the docs.path configuration option.
#
# docs.path

# RDF extractors can be configured for each DB with the following property. This is a comma separated 
# list of extractors that can consist of the following:

# A fully qualified class name of an RDF extractor registered via the service loader
# A simple class name of an RDF extractor registered via the service loader
# The string "tika" to enable the Apache Tika metadata extractor which reads embedded metadata

# docs.default.rdf.extractors=tika

# LDAP Authentication
# ---
# In order to enable LDAP authentication in Stardog, the following mandatory properties must be set

# security.realms=ldap

# The URL of the LDAP server
# ldap.provider.url=ldap://localhost:5860

# LDAP user allowed to retrieve group members from the LDAP server
# ldap.security.principal=uid=admin,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com

# Principal's password
# ldap.security.credentials=secret

# A template to form LDAP names from Stardog usernames
# ldap.user.dn.template=uid={0},ou=people,dc=example,dc=com

# A string to lookup the Stardog user groups
# ldap.group.lookup.string=ou=group,dc=example,dc=com

# The cn of the group identifying regular Stardog users
# ldap.users.cn=stardogUsers

# The cn of the group identifying Stardog super users
# ldap.superusers.cn=stardogSuperUsers

# The time duration to invalidate cache entries, default to 24h.
# ldap.cache.invalidate.time=1h

# Permissions and roles in Stardog might refer to users that no long exist, i.e., those that were deleted 
# from the LDAP server. This is safe as these users will not be able to authenticate (see above). It is possible 
# to configure Stardog to periodically clean up the list of permissions and roles according to the latest users 
# in the LDAP server. In order to do this, we pass a Quartz cron expression

# ldap.consistency.scheduler.expression = 0 0 18 * * ?

# High Availability Clustering
# ---

# Flag to enable the cluster, without this flag set, the rest of the properties have no effect
# pack.enabled=true

# this node's IP address (or hostname) where other Stardog nodes are going to connect
# pack.node.address=196.69.68.1

# the connection string for ZooKeeper where cluster state is stored
# pack.zookeeper.address=196.69.68.1:2180,196.69.68.2:2180,196.69.68.3:2180

# specifies the max time that Stardog waits to establish a connection to ZooKeeper
# pack.connection.timeout=15s

# specifies the session timeout 
# pack.session.timeout=60s
